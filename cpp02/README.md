The Orthodox Canonical Form (OCF) in C++ refers to the discipline of explicitly providing a specific set of special member functions for your class, to guarantee robust and predictable behavior when objects are created, copied, assigned, and destroyed.

What Functions Are Required?
Orthodox Canonical Form includes four (sometimes five) functions:

Default Constructor: Initializes an object with default values when no arguments are provided.

Copy Constructor: Enables initialization of a new object as a copy of an existing object.

Copy Assignment Operator (operator=): Allows an existing object to be assigned the values of another.

Destructor: Manages resource cleanup (memory, files, handles, etc.) when the object goes out of scope or is deleted.

Parameterized Constructor (sometimes included for completeness).

Typical class skeleton:

cpp

class Example {

public:

    Example();                               // Default constructor
    
    Example(const Example& other);           // Copy constructor
    
    Example& operator=(const Example& other);// Copy assignment operator
    
    ~Example();                              // Destructor
    
};

Why Is It Important?
If a class manages resources—like dynamic memory, or file handles—you must ensure they’re properly duplicated or freed during copy and destruction.

The default compiler-generated versions of these functions do not handle deep copies or custom cleanup—they perform shallow copying and default cleanup, which can lead to issues if your class uses pointers or references to resources.

Explicitly defining OCF guarantees correct behavior when objects are passed by value, assigned, or go out of scope.
